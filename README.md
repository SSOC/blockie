#Description
Blockie is a stratum based mining protocol. It is a replacement for *getwork* based pooling servers by allowing clients to generate work. The stratum protocol is described [here](http://mining.bitcoin.cz/stratum-mining) in full detail.

This is a implementation of the stratum services various cryptocurrency coins. It is compatible with *MPOS*. The end goal is to build on these standards to come up with a more efficient, optimized and stable solution.

The goal is to make a reliable stratum mining server for various cryptocurrency coins. Over time we will develop this to be more feature rich and very stable. If you would like to see a feature please file a feature request. 

**NOTE:** This fork is still in development. Many features may be broken. Please report any broken features or issues.
